We have different tours geared towards your ability ranging from 20 miles to 55 miles. Our rental bikes are great for riding on the canal towpath, the road or dirt country lanes. If you’re new to riding they offer the fun challenge of a more sporty ride that we think anyone can give a go on with one of the shorter tours, but are also great for plugging away the miles on our longer rides too.

One thing cyclists know is the love of coffee and cake stops while out on a ride. We nailed down the best places out there and all of our tours feature stops en route to help you refuel and enjoy the day out.

The Delaware River Valley and surrounding countryside is stunning and rich in history. The history of the River Towns dates back to before the USA was formed. New Hope was once called Coryell's Ferry, after the local Ferry operator in town. In 1790 a huge fire occurred and the reconstruction of the town was seen as “new hope” and the name took. George Washington crossed the Delaware River to win the Battle of Trenton which occurred just east of Lambertville and was a turning point in the Independence War. Take the River Towns Tours and learn about the history of six Towns as well as exploring country lanes and enjoying lunch.

### Tours start location

Unless arranged otherwise, all tours start at the tow path parking area on River Road, Lambertville, NJ.

If everyone on the tour is at a hotel in either Lambertville or New Hope area, we can arrange start at that location.
