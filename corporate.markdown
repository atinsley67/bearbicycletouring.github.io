Corporate Events
================

We cater to corporate events. If youâ€™re looking for a unique outdoor activity for an away day, we have a range of options available to build the perfect day out for your team or partners:

*   Bespoke mileage, difficulty, start and end time
*   Custom cycling clothing by Vie13 Kustom Apparel
*   Photography
*   Drone video recording
*   Hydration and nutrition by Osmo and Clif
*   In-ride activities, including farm stops, cooking classes or meal breaks

We encourage groups to use our rental bikes but riders can bring their own bikes if they want, and their bikes are suitable for the distance and road surface of your event.

We can also arrange multi day tours, for example an out and back ride with a single night stay in Clinton NJ or Easton PA with all riders luggage transported and an on the road support vehicle.
